This repository was created a year ago. It was intended to be used as my tech blog. At the time I was dabbling with learning a couple programming languages, setting up a home network, and building a couple devices. All while going to school and working full time. While I was able to complete some of those objectives, I was never able to successfully add in the recording and documentation steps that I had hoped to capture in the blog. During that time, I've also learned that I'm going to be a father. This new development has taken a lot of priority over my learning. That keyboard I've been building for the last year has been put off to set up a room instead. Research for router configuration and network security has switched to researching health insurance and physicians. The down time I spent practicing those new languages has been rebudgeted as time to sit and organize every piece of my life. In regards to my life and this _tech_ blog, there have been some changes. Previously, a lot of effort was put into my own learning and development. Now I'm shifting that development to a new human that I'm bringing into the world. Where I failed to capture documentation of my learning and personal projects in this blog, I hope to capture as much as I can of this new project. 

This is a change I'm happy for.

Cheers,
