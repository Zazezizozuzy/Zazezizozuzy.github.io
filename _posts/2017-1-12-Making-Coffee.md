title: Making Coffee
---

It's taking me a little longer than expected to really dive into the technical things that I was hoping to write up here. One major piece I want to nail down in the sustainability. Before building, I want to make sure I have a good foundation. Most of my projects usually get sidelined when I come across a major roadblock and I want to ensure that doesn't happen here. So for now, let's talk about coffee. 

I feel it is very much part of the sustainability of my work and school. It's a ritualistic thing. Something I've started using as a starting point for my day. Coffee used to be something I would grab a cup of when tired, or when I felt myself losing focus. When I started building this organization plan, I needed something to start my day with. A lot of recommendations from other devs said to read through your messages at the beginning of each day. This provides a simple task to start with, gives you an idea of what was completed the day before (especially if you send yourself updates), and gives you anything you need for the current day. Along with this, I add a cup of coffee. What I end up with is a nice, relaxing morning activity. While this is my first work related task, it actually starts with making the coffee.

### Morning Ritual

As soon as I walk in the office door, I hook up my computer, power it on, and start the coffee process. Beginning with grabbing my cup. It's a Minibru coffee mug. A sort of, French press + mug combo. I initially bought it after I broke my French press glass. The 'press' part didn't work so well, but I really like the way the cup looks. A minimalistic, transparent cup. While it tastes the same, coffee looks great in glass mugs.

The cup is usually dirty from the day before, so I head towards the kitchen. A digital kettle is set up there, set to 195 degrees. Though I always thought bothering with water tempurature was a bit snobby, I've messed with it and there is a noticeable difference. 205 used to be my standard. Then someone recommended 180, which gave a really good 'default coffee' flavour. You know, the flavor Foldgers is trying for? 180 gets you exactly that. Which is pleasing for most people. I however, prefer my coffee a bit thicker. I want that heavy flavour that fills your mouth. The kind that leaves an almost bitted flavour. 205 gave me that, but to a fault. It gave the theavier flavor, but came with a lot of acidity. This is partially due to how long I brew the coffee, but settling at 195 seemed to provide that fuller flavor, without adding the acidity.

While the water is boiling, I was my cup and prep everything. Since my French press broke and the Minimug was a poor system, I decided to try Aeropress. It is now my go to coffee maker for everything. Work, home, camping. It works well in almost every situation. If you're unfamiliar with the Aeropress, it's simple a manual, pressurized coffee maker. You place a tube like device over your cup. At the cup end, is a cap with a filter. Coffee grounds scooped into the tube are held up by the filter. You then pour in your hot water (and I give mine a little stir to blend the grounds). A small bit of coffee will start dripping through the filter. At this point, you take a plundger like device that fits inside the tube, and you push the coffee through. The device itself is a simple combination of drip and press makers and it makes my favorite coffee. As with most coffee makers, there are a lot of additional variabled. This one just makes it simple, quick, and is easy to clean. When the coffee is done, you simply remove the Aeropress from the top of the cup. Remove the bottom cap, push the bludger the rest of the way through to push the grounds and filter into a garbage, and then rinse it off. That's it. I then return to my coffee and add a bit of almond milk. Black coffee is delicious, but I find my teeth yellowing quite a bit since drinking it more. I then return to my desk to go through my messages.

This entire process takes less than five minutes. I end up with a delicious cup of coffee (sometimes multiple depending on the day) and a simple task to start the day.

Cheers,
