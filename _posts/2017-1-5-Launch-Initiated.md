This blog is intended to be a place for me to record things I do throughout the day. Whether it be related to work, school, or personal projects. I want to try to document some of this material for retention and better understanding. Public viewing allows for an open audience to see and critique what I do. If you come across anything that looks simply idiotic (and you will), please let me know. As I learn best from my mistakes.

Thanks,
Z&#151;
